A web page that simulates the classic game of Simon Says features a colorful and interactive interface, including buttons in four different colors, each with a unique sound. The game presents a series of increasingly difficult patterns that the player must replicate by pressing the buttons in the correct order. With each successful round, the game gets harder and the patterns become longer, keeping the player engaged and challenged. The game keeps track of the player's score and displays it at the end of each round. The use of sound and visual cues adds to the overall gaming experience, making it both engaging and enjoyable for players of all ages.
